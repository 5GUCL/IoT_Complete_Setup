  Next we introduce a simple class template whose sole job is to execute some code when the object
  goes out of scope. This little utility is useful for when dealing with C-style APIâ€™s, since the
  onus is typically on the programmer to remember to release resources, free memory, etc.
  This on_scope_exit object is designed to call a lambda at scope exit, so put any cleanup code you
  want to execute inside of it, and you will be exception-safe!
